I have honed my teaching style and skills over the span of seven semesters at UNC, both as the instructor-of-record and teaching assistant. During this time, I have designed two of my own courses, worked with students in small-class settings, and directed my own teaching assistants. For my work as an instructor, I was recognized by the UNC Political Science Department with the Earle Wallace Award for Graduate Student Teaching.

To make my expertise more accessible outside the traditional classroom setting, I teach a two-day seminar through the Odum Institute for Research in Social Science at UNC-Chapel Hill on collecting and analyzing text data in R. I make all my class materials publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/porter-rachel/odum_text_fall_2019/tree/master/Dropbox/Rachel/Text_Class). These experiences have prepared me to offer courses in American politics and political methodology at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.

### The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
- Poli 281: Quantitative Research in Political Science (Fall 2019; Spring 2020; Fall 2020)
    -  The course is target towards undergraduate students with interest in the social sciences, who want to use quantitative approaches to solve important problems as well as develop marketable analytical skills. This course is designed to achieve three objectives: (1) introduce students to research and quantitative analysis in political science, (2) produce critical consumers of quantitative analysis used in political and policy-oriented reporting, and (3) give students the ability to answer questions of social scientific importance using data. Over the course of the semester, students learn and become proficient in the statistical programming language R.

- Poli 100: Introduction to American Politics (Spring 2019)
    - In order to fully understand our complicated and contentious political climate and events, it is necessary to understand how the American political system works. We will work toward that understanding together by exploring the system from two angles: *institutions*, or the structure of the United States government; and *behavior*, or the actions and motivations of political actors, both politicians and the general public. We will discuss what problems the government and political system seek to solve and why they sometimes succeed and sometimes fail to solve those problems.

### Odum Institute for Research in Social Sciences at UNC
- Collecting and Analysing Text Using R (Spring 2019; Fall 2019; Spring 2020; Fall 2020)
    - This workshop will introduce participants to the basics of text analysis in R. Text analysis is a promising new approach that uses machine learning to discover patterns, trends, and other information by using text as data. For example, in measuring misinformation on social media to study how candidates have changed their campaign rhetoric over time, text analysis has an incredibly broad scope of applications. In this two day, five hour course, participants will develop the skills and understanding necessary to collect text data from a variety of sources, including websites and APIs. Participants will gain practical skills for completing their own analyses using text as data. Basic to intermediate knowledge of programming in R is required; no background in statistics is necessary.
