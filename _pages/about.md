Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science at the [University of Notre Dame](https://politicalscience.nd.edu/) and a Computational Social Science Faculty Fellow with the [Lucy Family Institute for Data and Society](https://lucyinstitute.nd.edu/). Additionally, I co-direct the [Representation and Politics in Legislatures Lab](https://rooneycenter.nd.edu/research/representation-and-politics-in-legislatures-lab/) within the [Rooney Center for American Democracy](https://rooneycenter.nd.edu/).   

My research centers on American political institutions, specifically the U.S. Congress, political representation, elections, and money in politics. My work has been published in outlets such as  *The Journal of Politics*,  *The American Journal of Political Science*, and  *Legislative Studies Quarterly*. My Google Scholar profile can be found [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CuQqTt4AAAAJ&hl=en).

My dissertation, *Some Politics Are Still Local: Strategic Position Taking in Congress & Elections*, won the American Political Science Association's [E.E. Schattschneider Award](https://politicalsciencenow.com/rachel-porter-receives-the-2023-e-e-schattschneider-award/) for the best dissertation on American government. This project employs an original collection of text data from congressional campaign websites to investigate candidates' strategic campaign position-taking. I received my Ph.D. from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2022 and a B.A. in Political Science and International Affairs from the University of Georgia in 2016.
